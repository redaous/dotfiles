1. Finish initial tmux config and setup.
   * See tm script
   * See tmux.conf
   * Requirements
     * Connecting via SSH to a host with an existing connection
       will "switch" to the existing window instead of opening a new one
     * SSH "Proxy" option for connecting to hosts that need a "jump box"
     * Multi session ... think "cluster ssh"
     * new windows for SSH sessions will have two panes by default
       and be split horizantally 75% on top, 25% on bottom

2. Create deploy script.
   * self extracting shell script?
   * Pull current ack?
   * Pull VIM modules?
